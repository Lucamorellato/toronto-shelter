    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>All of the data used here is provided by the City of Toronto <a href="https://open.toronto.ca/">Open Data</a> project. You can find the specific dataset here: <a href="https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/daily-shelter-occupancy/">Daily Shelter Occupancy.</a> Shelter Occupancy TO was not created to be a tool for finding an adequate shelter. If you need help finding shelter, please visit <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/housing-shelter/homeless-help/">Toronto Homeless Help</a>.</p>
    <p>The intention of this site was to highlight the occupancy rates of Toroto's shelters. The data reported, and the number of shelters open and beds counted will change as the year progresses, and the data is not always updated every weekday.</p>
